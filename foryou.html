            Cool huh? I made you this short program or short site just cause I wanted to give you something new!<br>
            <br>
           I want to start by saying thank you so much for always making time for me and for always giving you your attention and focus.<br>
            <br>
           I hope that you enjoyed spending time with me as much as I did with you, because as I mentioned to you yesterday, I am super happy with you, you make me remember that there is more to life than just working.<br>
            <br>
          And for showing me that I deserved to be loved the way that you love me. I will forever be grateful and appreciative of you my beautiful asawa!<br>
            <br>
            I am excited to come back home already and see you, I already have the urge to just spend time with you! But this week will be fast and before you know it, you are around my arms once again. <br>
            <br>
          Please always remember that I am with you, no matter how far I am, I am with you. I will make sure to call you every second that I get, even if I am in camp, I will call you whenever I get the opportunity to, I will update you like I always do hehehe.<br>
            <br>
            Take this time to also review for your finals and finish the prep for Caragan and any to-do's that you have to do alright my love? This 7 days will be quick and I will do my absolute best to ensure that I have time for you! <br>
